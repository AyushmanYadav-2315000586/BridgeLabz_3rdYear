Hiding of unnecessary or complex data is called abstraction.

Class is an instance of object
Abstract class(Uncomplete Class) is blueprint of class
Interface is the set of behaviors that a class must implement ensuring a class can perform certain actions regardless of its other relationships.
(It is a coding contract between two entities).


Concrete Method: The method which has its body or implementation
Non-Concrete Method: The method which does not has its body or implementation and it should be abstract


When we extend an abstract class to a normal class, we have two conditions to use abstract class method. 
Make the normal class to abstract class or override the method which we want to use (we can ignore keywords while overriding).
